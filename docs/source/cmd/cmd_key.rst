mist keys
*********
In order to provision multiple machines on different backends mist.io let's you upload your keys to be assigned to your provisioned
machines. You can also have mist.io service auto-generate new ssh-keys that'll be assigned to your new machines.

Add a new key
=============
You can use one of your existing keys and upload it to mist.io for further usage::

    mist add key --name MyKey --key /home/user/.ssh/mist_key

Or you can ask mist.io to auto-generate a key for you::

    mist add key --auto --name AutogeneratedKey

Keys Actions
============
To list all of your added keys::

    mist list keys

You can also inspect a specific key::

    mist show key --name MyKey

You have the option to rename a key::

    mist rename key --name MyKey --new_name RenamedKey

And delete one::

    mist delete key --name MyKey


You can see a full example `here`_.
